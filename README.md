# PyMidnite

A Python (2.7) library for interacting with Midnite Solar Charge Controllers

## Goals

The goal of this project is to allow the user to interact with Midnite Classic series battery charge controllers. 
Midnite classics communicate with applications over LAN or at mymidnite.com via Modbus/TCP or less robustly via USB.
The usb functionality will be strictly for data collection.
The modbus functionality will be for data collection and command.
